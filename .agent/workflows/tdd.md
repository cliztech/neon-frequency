# TDD Workflow

1.  **Ask User**: "What feature are we building?"
2.  **Create Test**: Create a verification script in `tests/verifications/verify_feature.py` that fails.
3.  **Verify Failure**: Run the test to confirm it fails.
4.  **Implement**: Write the code to make the test pass.
5.  **Verify Success**: Run the test again to confirm it passes.
6.  **Refactor**: Clean up the code if needed.
7.  **Commit**: `git commit -m "feat: [feature name] 🍌"`
