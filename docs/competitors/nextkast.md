## Enhancement ideas for Neon Frequency
- Add a simulcast relay input so automation can rebroadcast upstream streams on schedule.
- Expand playout overlays to support explicit sweeper overlay rules and next-start markers.
- Introduce external DSP chain configuration for processors like Stereo Tool or Breakaway.
- Build remote voice-tracking workflows (review, approve, and insert from outside the studio).
- Provide VOIP call handling in Live Assist (Skype/VOIP intake, record, and log).
- Add line-input routing alongside live mic handling for external consoles.
- Formalize backup/restore tooling for ops, including schedule/library snapshots.
- Publish operator shortcut maps for voice tracking and live-assist actions.
